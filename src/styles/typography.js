I care about the focus and flow programming adds to my life.
With the various disciplines I handle, I hope to create tools that inspire and contribute positivity to other lives.

I am currently a college student at McGill University, focusing on a double major in Computer Science and Music Performance.
Before, I was in highschool, performing internationally with the award-winning Jazz Band at Semiahmoo Secondary in Surrey, BC.
Since then, I have been doing professional work as a musician in Vancouver and Montreal.

My foray with code started with an introductory programming class in university; it's been history ever since.
I'm interested in Software Design, ML, Audio DSP, and overly enthuasiastic about music technology.

I'd love to hear from you! maxzhangvancouver@gmail.com
