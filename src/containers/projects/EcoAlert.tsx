                    <typography.SmallBody>
                        We wanted to create a eco-friendly options for consumers when shopping for products online. This was a challenge/designathon held by Design For Change 2021 for UX/UI students and young professionals. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        For me, this was an opportunity to gain more experience in design-orientated thinking and the UX process.

                    <typography.SmallBody>
                    Our solution is to create a browser extension which would automatically find eco-friendly alternatives for when users shop online. This solution is easily incorporated into a personâ€™s regular life as many climate change solution are difficult to initiate or follow. Our design fulfills our goals of: reminding users if they actually need the product before buying. If the item is eco- friendly, and if not, help users navigate to a more eco-friendly option.

                        How
                    </typography.Body>
                    <typography.SmallBody>
                    First, our team consisting of Amy Zhang, Jerry Feng, and myself defined the problem space. To do this, we researched the topic at hand, conducted user interviews, and using journey-maps and other tools, arrived to solid data.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Ideation followed. After arriving on the final concept, we refined the design after user testing and prototyping using Figma usability studies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Then, identifying the bright spots and pain points and adjusting, we arrived at a product design that we were confident to present!
