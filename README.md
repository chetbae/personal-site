# my personal website 🐟

## Why 
My first undertaking in using React back in 2020. Since then, I've needed a website to showcase my array of projects and experience as a software developer.

## What

This is a personal website developed with React-Typescript, bootstrapped with create-react-app. Hosted with vercel with a custom domain from google domains.

## How

I started the design process by drafting purely the aesthetics I desired in viewing the site. <i>(After coding for so long, it was quite an effort to take my mind of 'how' I could implement the look instead of just going for the big picture. Probably useful to apply later on too).</i>
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

Then I began implementing the high level structure for the site: site containers, style layouts, components, App-level dark mode (<- really wanted this one), etc... then the smaller details.

Finally, I just entered information of each page of my site as I drafted at the start. Also, I made sure to configure each page for mobile devices. 

These steps were re-iterative at times; I've learned a lot for the next time I make a frontend UI or application to streamline the process!
