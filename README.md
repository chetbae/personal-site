# my personal website üêü

## Why 

This has been a long time coming. During the remote-learning year of '20/'21, I began the process of applying to student internships. There I realized that there was a standard practice of a portfolio website amongst applicants, so I erected a makeshift static site to host my CV and projects. Since then I have delved into frontend development more, and with the summer rolling around I have found more time to engineer a better website.

## What

This is a personal website developed with React-Typescript, bootstrapped with create-react-app. Hosted through Heroku with a custom domain from google domains.

## How

I started the design process by drafting purely the aesthetics I desired in viewing the site. <i>(After coding for so long, it was quite an effort to take my mind of 'how' I could implement the look instead of just going for the big picture. Probably useful to apply later on too).</i>
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

Then I began implementing the high level structure for the site: site containers, style layouts, components, App-level dark mode (<- really wanted this one), etc... then the smaller details.

Finally, I just entered information of each page of my site as I drafted at the start. Also, I made sure to configure each page for mobile devices. 

These steps were re-iterative at times; I've learned a lot for the next time I make a frontend UI or application to streamline the process!
